Joystick Motor Controller

Objective: Control the Tekbot using an xbox or similar controller plugged into the laptop's USB port.

Goals:
	The robot is capable of moving forward, backward, left and right and can blink LEDs for the remaining buttons.
	The strength of the motion depends on the pushing power of the joystick.
	The code should be portable between UNIX variants
	The code should be easily installed and deployed

Starting Points
	Use the motor controller taken from the tekbot along with its battery system.
	Use the joy package in ROS along with our ROS deployment to observe controller commands and publish appropriate changes.
	Use Atmel Wonderboard to control applied voltage to motor controller?

Warnings:
	How much current can we draw from our computer withput hurting it? What is the maximum current draw of the motors.

Lofty Goals:
	Implement a mechanism that can be used to weed a garden
	Implement a ranging sensor that can detect when an obstacle is near
	Implement a camera feed and place a camera on top of the TekBot.
